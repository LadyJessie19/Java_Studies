# My Java/Spring Boot Studies ☕🍃

## 💡 **Description:**  
Hello! This repository is dedicated to my studies in Java, with a focus on Spring Boot. 
I decided to share these materials with the community because they've been incredibly helpful to me, and I believe we are stronger when we learn together.

## 🎁 **Folder Structure**
This repository is organized into two main folders:
- **JaVanilla:** A playful name representing pure Java. This section covers the basics of the language, including variables, data structures, control structures, and more. It's designed to introduce Java syntax to new learners.
- **SpringBoot:** These markdown files explain the fundamentals of building a Spring Boot Web API. The topics range from starting a new project to managing relationships between tables, and beyond.
